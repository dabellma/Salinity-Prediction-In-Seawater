For this project, my classmate Kati and I used water quality data from Data San Diego, and weather data from Visual Crossing Weather Data Services to correlate various water characteristics with water salinity. Some of these characteristics included pH levels, dissolved oxygen levels, density, chlorophyll levels, fecal matter levels, water temperature, and air temperature. We processed the 2 datasets on location and time commonalities and then split out all the features from the water salinity levels. 

Afterwards, we developed multiple neural network models with the PyTorch framework. We trained these models on 10 nodes using PyTorch's distributed training features. For analysis of the neural network models, we calculated objective and subjective weights using Pearson Coefficients of feature comparisons with each other and with water salinity levels in PPT (parts per thousand). We trained the models with MSE loss and determined the percentage error rate between the predicted and actual water salinity levels.
